# Sentiment-Analysis-Classifier

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to design a classifier for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5-point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

## Tasks
To automatically analyze reviews, you will need to complete the following tasks:
1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers:
   - The perceptron algorithm
   - The average perceptron algorithm
   - The Pegasos algorithm
2. Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.
3. Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.

## Software Requirements
For this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- matplotlib

## Project Files
- `project1.py`: Contains various useful functions and function templates that you will use to implement your learning algorithms.
- `main.py`: A script skeleton where these functions are called and you can run your experiments.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions that the staff has implemented for you.
- `test.py`: A script which runs tests on a few of the methods you will implement. Note that these tests are provided to help you debug your implementation and are not necessarily representative of the tests used for online grading.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sourena-Mohit/Sentiment-Analysis-Classifier.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-Classifier
   ```
